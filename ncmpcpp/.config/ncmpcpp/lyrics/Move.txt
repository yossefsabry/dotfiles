Fire burnin'
Style gunnin', ayy
I'm feenin', I just want a taste
Got the feelin' you don't wanna wait
I know that you want me here and now

Know you wanna party
Listen to your body
I want to get naughty

Girl, I really like the way you move, move, move
Girl, I really like the way you move, move, move
Girl, I really like the way you move
Girl, I really like the way you—
Girl, I really like the way you—

Body turnin'
Let me work it, ayy
Put it on me, my hands on your waist
Later, you can come over my place
I know that you want me here and now

Know you wanna party
Listen to your body
I want to get naughty

Girl, I really like the way you move, move, move
Girl, I really like the way you move, move, move
Girl, I really like the way you move
Girl, I really like the way you—
Girl, I really like the way you move

Know you wanna party
Listen to your body
I want to get naughty
Girl, I really like the way you—
