Hello, bye-bye
Don't need you with me tonight
All good, all fine
My heart is all mine
No games, no lies
Put all that shit to the side

The things that I do, boy, you could never
'Cause at the end of the day, I do it better
The thing that I got, got it forever
Touching my dreams, I'm in the center
'Cause at the end of the day, I do it better

I like the feeling that I feel when I'm next to you
But when I'm sleeping by myself, yeah, I see it through
From start to finish, I know I didn't come to lose
'Cause at the end of the day, I do it better

'Cause at the end of the day, I do it better
'Cause at the end of the day, I do it better

Hello, bye-bye
Don't need you with me tonight
All good, I'm fine
My heart is all mine
Hello, bye-bye
Don't need you with me tonight
I'm good, I'm fine
My heart is all mine

All day, all night
This how I'm spending my time
No tears, no fights
No one to make me cry
Hello, bye-bye
Thank you for showing me why

I like the feeling that I feel when I'm next to you
But when I'm sleeping by myself, yeah, I see it through
From start to finish, I know I didn't come to lose
'Cause at the end of the day, I do it better

'Cause at the end of the day, I do it better
'Cause at the end of the day, I do it better

Hello, bye-bye
Don't need you with me tonight
All good, I'm fine
My heart is all mine
Hello, bye-bye
Don't need you with me tonight
I'm good, I'm fine
My heart is all mine

(I do it better, I do it better, I do it better
I do it better, I do it better, I do it better)
I do I better
(I do it better, I do it better, I do it better
I do it better, I do it better)
'Cause at the end of the day, I do it better
