There's a place you gotta be
A thousand leagues beneath the sea
And it's waitin' over here for you and me
Gonna take you for a ride
But first, you gotta come inside
Get ready for...the party's on tonight!

So pack up, cash in
And get ready to begin
Toss the dice, once or twice
Baby, we're winning
Ain't no sense
So relax and just unwind
Leave your worries all behind
And get ready for...the party on tonight!

Oh, smalls, the bigs are on the way
'Cause when the big fish come to train
Guarantee you have best night of your life
Dry your socks and shine your shoes
Tell your friends to spread the news
We're ready 'cause the party's on tonight

So pack up and cash in
And get ready to begin
Toss the dice, once or twice
Baby, we're winning
Ain't no sense
So relax and just unwind
Leave your worries all behind
So get ready...it's party time!
It's party time!
