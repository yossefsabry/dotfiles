When you're low and your knees can't rise
You feel helpless and you're looking to the sky
Some people would say to accept defeat
Well if this is fate then we'll find a way to cheat

'Cause oh oh oh oh, we'll say a little prayer
But oh oh oh oh, if the answer isn't fair

You know you can call on me
When you need somebody
You know you can call on me
When you can't stop the tears from falling down (down)
So you know you can call on me
Call on me darling'
You know you can call on me
You can't stop the tears from falling down
(down)

When you're weary and the road is dark
Then I'll guide you with the beating of my heart
And if the cavalry and the help don't come
Then we'll find a way to dodge a smoking gun

'Cause oh oh oh oh, we'll say a little prayer
But oh oh oh oh, if the answer isn't fair

You know you can call on me
When you need somebody
You know you can call on me
When you can't stop the tears from falling down
(down)
You know you can call on me
Call on me darling'
You know you can call on me
You can't stop the tears from falling down
(down)

When you, you need someone
You need somebody cling to
When you, you need someone
You need somebody to dry your tears
When you, you need someone
You need somebody to cling to
Call on me love, on me-e-e
Call on me
Just call on me
Call on me
Just call on me
