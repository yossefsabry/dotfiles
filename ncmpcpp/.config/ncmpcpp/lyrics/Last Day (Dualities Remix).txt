We're alive, oh we're alive
But we're running out of time
Kiss me once or kiss me twice
Cause in the morning we might not be here

Cause if the world is ending tomorrow
You better come back tonight
You better come back
I'll return the love that I borrowed
If you come back tonight
If you come back

Hey whatcha doing on your last day here on earth
Let's pretend the meteors are fireworks
We can cry or we can laugh until it hurts
Let's raise a glass to the last day here on earth

Now there's panic in the streets
The city's burning at our feet
But as long as you're with me
I don't care if there's nowhere to be

So if the world is ending tomorrow
You better come back tonight
You better come back
I'll give back the love that I borrowed
You better come back tonight
You better come back

Hey whatcha doing on your last day here on earth
Let's pretend the meteors are fireworks
We can cry or we can laugh until it hurts
Let's raise a glass to the last day here on earth

One more chance, one more hour's all I'm asking
One more dance like it's our grand finale
If the world's ending now then I'll die happy
If you're right at my side, so you better come back tonight

Hey whatcha doing on your last day here on earth
Let's pretend the meteors are fireworks
We can cry or we can laugh until it hurts
Let's raise a glass to the last day here on earth
