Here I am under your broken eyes
As you say I'm sorry
But I won't be the one
To give you a second chance
I'll wait for you to say
I should have known better
But this is how it goes
I'll be gone before long.

Don't give up
I take pride in breaking hearts
And faking love.
You'll die soon enough,
But for now I'll pretend
That I miss you.

And I'll defend
Each and every part of me
Your hands aren't clean
When you touch me
You and your disease.

This is my last chance
To make you feel
The way I felt that night
I can only hope
That you hate the way
I tear you up inside
One more thing before I go..
Maybe next time
You won't show me that you care.

Why should I waste my time
After all you put me through
(I think) It's time to turn my back on you.
