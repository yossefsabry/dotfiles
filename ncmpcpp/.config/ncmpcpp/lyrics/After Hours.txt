Keep that rap in the water boys, Tonight is not about you. I’m just hanging with my girls, so we can act a fool. Drinks in our hands, girls let’s go dance. Lets drink up our beers, it’s after hours. Theres no stopping, bass is pumping. love is jumping. It’s after hours. Whipping my hair, make the boys stare. Just don’t go there. It’s after hours. Music is loud, feeling this proud. Screaming out loud, It’s after hours. All i wanna do is just dance tonight, let my hair down. Hanging with my girls and it feels so right. We keep it going till the morning light. uhhh. Ahhhhhhh. Finally I have free time, been working hard all week. Friday night I had a date, we couldn’t rock this beat. Tonight i’m hanging with my girls, I’m dazing like a freak.
