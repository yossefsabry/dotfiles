Instructor: Dr. Mohammed El-Telbany

Purpose

Generative AI refers to a subset of artificial intelligence models capable of producing new data that resemble their training examples. These models—commonly based on neural networks such as GANs, VAEs, and transformers—can create multimedia elements like text, images, audio, video, or code. This assignment aims to:

Strengthen understanding of digital multimedia elements.

Develop skills in using generative AI tools to create multimedia components.

Code Generation	GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT (Developer mode), Replit Ghostwriter, Amazon CodeWhisperer	Free + Paid	Generate or autocomplete code in multiple languages.
Presentation / Design	Canva Magic Studio, Tome AI, Gamma App	Free + Paid	Create AI-assisted slides, infographics, and banners.
Challenge 2 – Banner Creation Using Grok AI

Task: Use Grok AI (a generative AI tool) to create a banner for the following syntax:

“Sinai University: Digital Multimedia Course •”

Process Description

Prompt used:
“Create a clean, professional banner that includes the text ‘Sinai University: Digital Multimedia Course •’. Use a modern style with the university’s blue and white colors and subtle digital-themed icons (camera, music note, code symbol, etc.).”

Tool used: Grok AI (X by Elon Musk)

Output: An AI-generated banner featuring the course title with digital multimedia visuals (icons for video, sound, and coding).

Result: The banner can be used in class materials or course websites.
